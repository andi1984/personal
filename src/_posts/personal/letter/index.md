title: A Letter to My Younger Self

This could be a letter to my younger self as a starting frontend developer, sharing insights and lessons learned over the years. But maybe it could also be a letter to anyone starting out in the field, offering encouragement and advice.

Dear Younger Me,

I hope this letter finds you well. As I sit down to write this, I am reflecting on the journey I have taken as a frontend developer. It has been a transformative experience, and I am grateful for the lessons I have learned along the way.

## Embrace A Healthy Portion of Curiosity

Curiosity and willingness to explore new technologies and approaches are essential traits for any developer due to the nature of software development. Don't be afraid to experiment with things outside your comfort zone, but keep it on a healthy level. Don't get lost in the endless sea of new frameworks and libraries; instead, focus on mastering the fundamentals first. In the beginning the _fear of missing out_ (short FOMO) can be overwhelming, but remember that true growth comes from deep understanding, not just surface-level knowledge of the latest trends.

## Focus on Fundamentals

During your career you will **ALWAYS** come back to the fundamentals. Whether it is a specific piece of code of a framework that you are using, or a general concept like accessibility or performance optimization, the fundamentals will always be your foundation. Invest time in understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript deeply. These are the building blocks of everything you will create. And believe me that browsing [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) will always bring new HTML tags, CSS properties, and JavaScript functions to your attention. For fun and learning you can try something like Powerpoint karaoke: Pick a random MDN article and talk about it for a few minutes as if you were teaching it to someone else – [The WorkingDraft "Gluecksrad"](https://workingdraft.de/gluecksrad/) is your friend here.

## Build Side Projects Whenever Possible

Side projects are invaluable for learning and growth. They allow you to apply what you've learned in a practical way and explore new ideas without the constraints of a work environment. Don't be afraid to start small; even simple projects can teach you a lot. Over time, these side projects will become a portfolio that showcases your skills and creativity. You will never imagine that a weekend project will end up in [a tool used by thousands of developers worldwide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andi1984.tinypng).

## Network and Connect with Others

Go to meetups, join conferences and try to keep in touch with those people you meet and feel connected to. The developer community is full of talented and passionate individuals who are eager to share their knowledge and experiences. Building a network of peers can provide support, inspiration, and opportunities for collaboration. Don't hesitate to reach out to others for advice or mentorship; most people are happy to help. Especially if you are an introvert like me, try to push yourself a little bit out of your comfort zone. The connections you make can lead to new opportunities and friendships that will enrich your career and personal life.

Between meeting offline, consider also joining online communities like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/ where you can engage in discussions, ask questions, and share your own experiences.

## Use AI as a further tool in your toolbox

Instead of vibe coding all the way down, be eager to _learn how AI can help me_. Use it as a further tool in your toolbox, not as a replacement for your own skills. Also review with care and always keep understanding of what is generated. But be open to embrace AI tools as any other tool that can help you as a developer.

## Have a counter part outside of coding
In the tech industry it is easy to get lost in the code and the next _big thing_, especially when you work remotely where boundaries between work and private life can blur.

Your private life and human, non-digital interactions are essential for your well-being and overall happiness. Make sure to nurture relationships outside of work, pursue hobbies, and take time to disconnect from screens. Your back, eyes and in general your body will thank you.

 A balanced life will not only make you a happier person but also a more effective and creative developer.

## Desk work is poison for your body
Remember to take care of your physical health. Sitting for long hours can lead to various health issues. Make it a habit to take breaks, stretch, and move around regularly. Consider incorporating exercise into your routine, whether it's a daily walk, having a big garden or hitting the gym. Following this in your 20s and 30s will pay off in your 40s and 50s.
